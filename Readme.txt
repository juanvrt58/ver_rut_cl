This is a task that I did for the programming elective of III media 
in 2019, which we had to create a code that would allow us to identify
if a rut is valid for the Chilean system of verifier of rut. This code
was the one that had the least lines, and the most "profecional". Resulting
in maximum score. This is part of my portfolio.
